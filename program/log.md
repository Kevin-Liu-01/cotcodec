## 2026-10-06 — Program restart

- Verified all 18 candidate questions from Codex's research reset, Codex's
  five-direction ranking, the existing program and an H100 sweep. Three
  independent judges ranked them. 102 cited URLs audited: 95 OK, 7 fixed, 0
  removed. Codex's five-direction claims: 42 verified, 2 corrected.
- Chose three questions: Q1 kernel correctness-gate strength, Q2 calibrated
  computer-use instrument, Q3 cross-script sparse-indexer recall (carried over
  from D21). Ordered the backfill queue and dropped six lines with reasons.
- Moved the previous program to `legacy/` with history preserved (`git mv`),
  tagged `legacy-2026-10-06`. Kept live: the Docker and Slurm submitters,
  provenance and attestation tools, `orx` dispatcher, D21 contract and doctor,
  model registries, research-gauntlet rules and vendored skills.
- The Docker submitter now rejects archived memory workloads before any other
  memory-specific check. The `orx` default node now points to the D21 doctor.
- Restored the gauntlet procedure and evidence model to `docs/`, and the
  proposal template, evidence schema and D21 proposal to `program/proposals/`.
- Path references in the D21 contract and proposal were updated to the new
  layout. No gate, threshold or result in them changed.
- Removed from the public tree: an employer-internal corpus inventory and the
  host address. Kept out of the commit: a local Slack bot directory and an
  unfinished Letta doctor that demonstrates an undisclosed issue. All are in a
  private archive outside the repository. Old copies of the first two remain
  in public git history.
- No GPU job ran. GPU-hours spent by this program: 0.

## 2026-10-06 — Stage 0 begins

- Created a clean host clone of `main` at `~/cotcodec-main` for program work;
  the older host checkout with Codex's uncommitted edits is left untouched.
- Fetched `qwen3-0.6b-base` (Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base at revision
  `da87bfb608c14b7cf20ba1ce41287e8de496c0cd`) with a receipt through Slurm job
  365 in image `cotcodec-research:0b3ecef0-architecture`. Terminal state
  COMPLETED, exit 0:0. Receipt artifact-root SHA-256
  `7040f418762c61dd00b540e482527e0d8c8a916cce80eee56408bd10a6179ae0`.
- Scoping workflow launched for six Stage-0 items: evaluator mutation kit,
  Holo3 archive diff, Q3 K1, Q1 gate stack, action-path suite and VM runtime,
  and the serving throughput probe.
